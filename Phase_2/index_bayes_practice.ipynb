There are two major decisions involved: what _location_ he gets the puppy from, and what _size_ the puppy is.\n\nThe possible **locations** for getting the puppy are the **pet store** or the **pound**. These are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive probabilities, meaning that Thomas will only go to one location, and there is a 100% probability that he will go to one of these two locations. We'll represent those probabilities as $P(Pet Store)$ and $P(Pound)$ as needed.\n\nThe possible puppy **sizes** are **small**, **medium**, or **large**. Again, these are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive probabilities, so a given puppy has only one size and there is a 100% probability that Thomas will get a puppy with one of these three sizes. We'll represent those probabilities as $P(Small)$, $P(Medium)$, and $P(Large)$ as needed.\n\n### Known Probabilities\n\n1. $P(Pet Store) = 0.2$\n   * The probability of Thomas going to the pet store is 20%\n2. $P(Small \\mid Pet Store) = 0.6$\n   * If he goes to the pet store, the probability of him getting a small puppy is 60%\n3. $P(Medium \\mid Pet Store) = 0.3$\n   * If he goes to the pet store, the probability of him getting a medium puppy is 30%\n4. $P(Large \\mid Pet Store) = 0.1$\n   * If he goes to the pet store, the probability of him getting a large puppy is 10%\n5. $P(Small \\mid Pound) = 0.1$\n   * If he goes to the pound, the probability of him getting a small puppy is 10%\n6. $P(Medium \\mid Pound) = 0.35$\n   * If he goes to the pound, the probability of him getting a medium puppy is 35%\n7. $P(Large \\mid Pound) = 0.55$\n   * If he goes to the pound, the probability of him getting a large puppy is 55%\n\n### Formula Reminders\n\nThis is the formula for Bayes' theorem:\n\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\dfrac{P(B \\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n\nIn other words, the probability of A given B is the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.\n\nAdditionally, recall the law of total probability:\n\n$$P(A) = \\sum_i P(A \\mid B_i)P(B_i)$$\n\nIn other words, the probability of A is the sum of all (probability of A given B times the probability of B) for all B.\n\n### Requirements\n\n#### 1. What is the probability of Thomas getting a small puppy?\n\n#### 2. Given that he got a large puppy, what is the probability that Thomas went to the pet store?"},{"metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"79a9ace3cc1a2385a4386e644789573e","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-f8f520a0a0b8652a","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false,"task":false}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.
